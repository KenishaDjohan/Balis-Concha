            The most important skills are preferably taught and developed at a young age. Thus, Saint Ursula Junior High School Jakarta decided to include those abilities in the Integrated Learning Project, which all students ranging from seventh to ninth grade partake in. Depending on the grade that they are in, leadership and entrepreneurship skills are harnessed by the students at different levels. However, due to the project that was assigned to them, abilities such as those are especially strengthened by the ninth graders. </p>
        <p class="bubble-text1">On the 14th and 16th of January, a bazaar was managed by us students in the ninth grade. All subjects were embodied in this particular project, such as social studies, arts and crafts, science, and many more. The materials that were taught to us also improved our understanding in multiple aspects regarding business and management skills. A few examples of what we learnt are statistics, creating products of our own choice, as well as selling them to the public. Materials such as biotechnology were also included in this type of situation, whereas our group specifically decided to make aromatic scented candles from used cooking oil. </p>
        <p class="bubble-text1"> Products such as tote bags, stickers, accessories, foods, and drinks can be found on some stalls throughout the bazaar’s running time, all of which were prepared as best as possible by their respective sellers. Thanks to the students and the guests’ enthusiasm, all of the groups were able to have most of their products sold when it was time for them to tidy up their stall.</p>
